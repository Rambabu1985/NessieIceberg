# Nessie Server upgrade notes

The following table lists the upgrade types from one Nessie version to another Nessie version.

A check-mark in the _Rolling Upgrade_ column means that it is okay to run Nessie instances running
versions in the _From_ column during the limited time of a rolling-upgrade with Nessie versions
in the _To_ column.

A red cross in the _Rolling Upgrade_ column means that rolling upgrades for the mentioned versions
are not supported and must be avoided.
