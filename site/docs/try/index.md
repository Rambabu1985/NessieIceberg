# Getting Started

For a quick overview of nessie capabilities, several demos which do not require
any special setup except for a web browser have been made available:

* [Nessie, Iceberg and Spark via Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/projectnessie/nessie-demos/main?filepath=colab%2Fnessie-iceberg-demo-nba.ipynb)
* [Nessie, Iceberg and Spark via Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/projectnessie/nessie-demos/blob/main/colab/nessie-iceberg-demo-nba.ipynb)
* [Nessie, Deltalake, Spark via Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/projectnessie/nessie-demos/main?filepath=colab%2Fnessie-delta-demo-nba.ipynb)
* [Nessie, Deltalake, Spark via Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/projectnessie/nessie-demos/blob/main/colab/nessie-delta-demo-nba.ipynb)

The [nessie-demos](https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie-demos) repository contains a full list of all available Jupyter Notebooks that show how nessie can be used with other technologies.

For people who are interested in trying out all nessie features, they can use
the docker images published with each release and setup the server by following
the instructions available [here](docker.md)
