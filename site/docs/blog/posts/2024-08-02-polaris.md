# Open Source Polaris announcement

As many of you have already heard, the Polaris repository is now open source under the Apache License 2. The
[announcement](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/polaris-catalog-open-source/) mentions "The team at Dremio is excited to
help bring the various functions and capabilities of Nessie into the Polaris project.". Let me elaborate on what this
means for now and the foreseeable future.
<!-- more -->

The Nessie project was started about 4 years ago and has attracted a lot of users creating a big community around it.
We, the Nessie OSS team, are really proud of this development. We also look forward to further strengthening the
community around Nessie.

The intent is to contribute Nessieâ€™s <u>capabilities</u>, like Catalog Level Versioning, Git-like semantics, multi-table
transaction semantics to Polaris. We look forward to working with the Polaris community in this regard.
