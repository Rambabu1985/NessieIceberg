 * operations.
 *
 * <p>Database-adapters treat the actual "Nessie contents" and "Nessie commit metadata" as an opaque
 * value ("BLOB") without interpreting the contents. Database-adapter must persist serialized values
 * for commit-metadata and contents as is and must return those in the exact same representation on
 * read.

 * org.projectnessie.versioned.persist.nontx.NonTxDatabaseAdapter} (NoSQL databases) or {@code
 * org.projectnessie.versioned.persist.tx.TxDatabaseAdapter} (JDBC/transactional). Both in turn
 * extend {@link org.projectnessie.versioned.persist.adapter.spi.AbstractDatabaseAdapter}.
