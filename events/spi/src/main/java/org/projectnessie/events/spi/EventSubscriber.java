 * <p>Implementations must be properly registered in a {@code
 * META-INF/services/org.projectnessie.events.spi.EventSubscriber} file. They will be then
 * discovered and loaded by the ServiceLoader mechanism.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface must not block. If blocking I/O is required, then the {@link
 * #isBlocking()} method should return {@code true}.
 *
 * <p>Please note that this interface may evolve in the future, and more methods may be added. These
 * will always be default methods, so that existing implementations will continue to work. But it is
 * important that SPI implementers be prepared to cope with such evolutions.
