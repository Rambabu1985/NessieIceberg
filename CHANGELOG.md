  commands.

### Changes

### Deprecations

### Fixes

### Commits

## [0.69.0] Release (2023-08-25)

### Fixes
- Nessie CLI: check-content command was incorrectly reporting deleted keys as missing content, when
  using new storage model.
- GC Tool handles JDBC config via environment correctly

## [0.68.0] Release (2023-08-24)

### Upgrade notes
- If a repository has been imported using Nessie CLI 0.68.0 or higher, then this repo cannot be
  later served by a Nessie server whose version is lower than 0.68.0. This is due to a change in the
  internal repository description format.

### New Features
- Support BigTable in Helm charts
- NessieCLI check-content command is now compatible with Nessie's new storage model

### Changes
- Java client API to assign/delete reference operations without specifying a concrete reference type
  (no change to REST API).
- Creating and assigning references now requires a target hash to be specified.

### Fixes
- Secondary commit parents are now properly exported and imported
- Fix volume declarations for RocksDB in Helm
- Remove unnecessary repository-deletion when importing a legacy Nessie repo
- GC Tool uber-jar now includes AWS STS classes
- GC Tool now logs at `INFO` instead of `DEBUG`
- GC Tool now correctly works against PostgreSQL

## [0.67.0] Release (2023-08-02)

### Upgrade notes
- Tracing and metrics have been migrated to Quarkus "native". The options to en/disable metrics and tracing have been removed. Please remove the options `nessie.version.store.trace.enable`, `nessie.version.store.metrics.enable` from your Nessie settings.

### Changes
- Nessie API spec upgraded to 2.1.1
- Support for relative hashes has been standardized and is now allowed in all v2 endpoints
- Migrate to Quarkus metrics and tracing
