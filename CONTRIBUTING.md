# Contributing to Nessie
## How to contribute
Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the Nessie project. We welcome of course code changes, 
but we are also grateful for bug reports, feature suggestions, helping with testing and 
documentation, or simply spreading the word about Nessie.

There are several ways to get in touch with other contributors:
 * Slack: get an invite to the channel by emailing slack-subscribe@projectnessie.org
 * Google Groups: You can join the discussion at https://groups.google.com/g/projectnessie

More information are available at https://projectnessie.org/develop/

## Code of conduct
You must agree to abide by the Project Nessie [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting issues
Issues can be filed on GitHub. Please use the template and add as much detail as possible. Including the 
version of the client and server, how the server is being run (eg docker image) etc. The more we 
know the more we can help :-)

### Feature Requests

If you have a feature request or questions about the direction of the project please join the slack channel
and ask there. It helps build a richer discussion and more people can be involved than when posting as an issue.

### Large changes or improvements

We are excited to accept new contributors and larger changes. Please join the mailing list and post a proposal 
before submitting a large change. This helps avoid double work and allows the community to arrive at a consensue
on the new feature or improvement.
